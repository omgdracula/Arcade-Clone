# Arcade Game Clone (Frogger) #
We can't use a frogger so I will call this game Bugger

## Getting Started ##
Clone down or download the project files and open up the folder.
Click on index.html to load the game.

## Playing The Game ##
Use your arrow keys on your keyboard to control Bugger.
Avoid the bugs otherwise they will eat you and return you to the beginning of the platform.
It is a bug eat bug world out there!

Make it to the water and win!

## About This Project ##
This project was created using HTML/CSS and JavaScript.
I followed the best practices to implement OOP styled JavaScript by creating
Player (the boy) and Enemy (the bugs) classes which handle specfic attributes
and methods of each object. Currently this is the basis of the project, however
I would consider adding more onto it to better the gameplay.
